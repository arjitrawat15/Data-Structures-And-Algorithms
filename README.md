# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms

This repository contains my **self-practice work on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
All solutions are written **independently by me** as part of my continuous learning and problem-solving journey.

## 🚀 What this repository includes

- DSA problems solved on:
  - **LeetCode**
  - **GeeksforGeeks**
  - **Codeforces**
  - Other competitive programming platforms
- Implementations primarily in **C++**
- Well-structured topic-wise folders for easy navigation

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **Arrays** – Array-based problems and techniques  
- **SlidingWindow** – Sliding window patterns and optimizations  
- **Trees** – Binary Trees, BSTs, traversals, and related problems  
- *(More topics will be added as I continue practicing)*

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

- Strengthen my **problem-solving skills**
- Build a solid foundation in **core DSA concepts**
- Maintain a **personal archive** of solved problems
- Track my **daily/regular practice progress**
- Prepare for **coding interviews and internships**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Focus:** Clean logic, optimal approaches, and clarity

## 📈 Ongoing Work

This repository is **actively maintained** and will keep growing as I solve more problems and explore advanced topics.
